AppendLastNToFirst
Send Feedback
You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with an integer 'N'. Write a function to append the last 'N' nodes towards the front of the singly linked list and returns the new head to the list.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space. 

The second line contains the integer value 'N'. It denotes the number of nodes to be moved from last to the front of the singly linked list.
Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
Output format :
For each test case/query, print the resulting singly linked list of integers in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a seperate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
0 <= N < M
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Sample Output 2 :
90 61 67 100 10 6 77 
 Explanation to Sample Input 2 :
We have been required to move the last 4 nodes to the front of the list. Here, "90->61->67->100" is the list which represents the last 4 nodes. When we move this list to the front then the remaining part of the initial list which is, "10->6->77" is attached after 100. Hence, the new list formed with an updated head pointing to 90.

You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function to print the list in a reverse order.
To explain it further, you need to start printing the data from the tail and move towards the head of the list, printing the head data at the end.

You canâ€™t change any of the pointers in the linked list, just print it in the reverse order.
 Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first and the only line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

Delete every N nodes

You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with two integers, 'M,' and 'N.' Traverse the linked list such that you retain the 'M' nodes, then delete the next 'N' nodes. Continue the same until the end of the linked list.
To put it in other words, in the given linked list, you need to delete N nodes after every M nodes.
Note :
No need to print the list, it has already been taken care. Only return the new head to the list.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case or query contains the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.

The second line of input contains two integer values 'M,' and 'N,' respectively. A single space will separate them.
 Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element

kReverse

Given a singly linked list of integers, reverse the nodes of the linked list 'k' at a time and return its modified list.
 'k' is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of 'k,' then left-out nodes, in the end, should be reversed as well.
Example :
Given this linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

For k = 2, you should return: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5

For k = 3, you should return: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5
