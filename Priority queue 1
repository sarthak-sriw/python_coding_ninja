Complete binary tree -- 
1 All level should be completely filled except the last level
2 First left child then right child be inserted  ie left tp right insertion

Removal = 
Removal from right to left child and last level to top

Height = log(n)

Heap is Complete binary tree (2 child) and heap order property
min heap - parent value must be less than child value  ie minimum valaue at top
(no concept of bst less than greater thanP)
max head - parent priority value higher than child value  ie maximum value at top


Insert at last and then make changes

Deletion min
1 delete 1 node and replace with last element and then adjust the tree

      10
   20    30
  40 50 60  70
80

next insert beside 80 as chikd oof 40
next insert beside 40 as chikd oof 50

array for heap 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
                0 1   2  3  4  5  6  7
                
                anyones child of parent  -  2*i+1,2*i+2  --i--> index of parent
