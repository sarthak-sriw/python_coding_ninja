Huffman Coding -- text compression algo


BCAADDDCCACACAC
Each character occupies 8 bits. There are a total of 15 characters in the above string. Thus, a total of 8 * 15 = 120 bits are required to send this string.

Using the Huffman Coding technique, we can compress the string to a smaller size.

Huffman coding first creates a tree using the frequencies of the character and then generates code for each character.

Once the data is encoded, it has to be decoded. Decoding is done using the same tree.


1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Sort the characters in increasing order of the frequency. These are stored in a priority queue Q.
3.Make each unique character as a leaf node.
4. Create an empty node z. Assign the minimum frequency to the left child of z and assign the second minimum frequency to the right child of z. Set the value of the z as the sum of the above two minimum frequencies.
5.Remove these two minimum frequencies from Q and add the sum into the list of frequencies (* denote the internal nodes in the figure above).
6.Insert node z into the tree.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all the characters.
8. For each non-leaf node, assign 0 to the left edge and 1 to the right edge.

For sending the above string over a network, we have to send the tree as well as the above compressed-code. The total size is given by the table below.

 

Character	Frequency	Code	Size
A	          5	      11	  5*2 = 10
B	        1	       100	  1*3 = 3
C	                  6	  0  	6*1 = 6
D	3	101	3*3 = 9
4 * 8 = 32 bits	15 bits	 	28 bits
 

Without encoding, the total size of the string was 120 bits. After encoding the size is reduced to 32 + 15 + 28 = 75.


Huffman Coding Algorithm
create a priority queue Q consisting of each unique character.
sort then in ascending order of their frequencies.
for all the unique characters:
    create a newNode
    extract minimum value from Q and assign it to leftChild of newNode
    extract minimum value from Q and assign it to rightChild of newNode
    calculate the sum of these two minimum values and assign it to the value of newNode
    insert this newNode into the tree
return rootNode
